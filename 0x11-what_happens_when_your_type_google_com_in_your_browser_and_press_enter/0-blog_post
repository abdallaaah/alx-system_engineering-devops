In this blog, we will cover what happens when you type google.com in your browser and press enter in a simple way that you can explain to anyone if this one is your grandma. To begin with this topic clarity we have to ask what is the internet first. let’s think about the internet as a street and websites as shops. Web Servers (shops) are the place where all the action happens, where people come to buy (access websites) and get what they need. this shop must have a warehouse to store what they sell. this warehouse is called a Database.

The database of the web server is the location that stores and retrieves data from and to you when you ask (query) about things. Query = Ask in the database world. this is a database simply, I think your grandma now should understand what it is.

If you need to go to Google.com (the shop) or the web address you have to know its address. so this address in the internet world they refer to as IP address, from it is the name address of the shop. but in the internet world, It’s a little different. Every website has a unique IP address that just contains some numbers you don’t have to know its meaning now, remember it is just a number. and because the mean human brain language is letters they invented a technique to reach the website with just letters which are translated to numbers which are the actual numbers of the IP address.

so when you type www.google.com it converts to 8.8.8.8 which is the address of the Google website. the responsibility of this operation is something called DNS. It converts the website letters to the real address number of the website you want to reach. A device’s request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to provide an IP address for a given hostname. that’s all about DNS simply. let’s back to our road example, For now, there must be something guaranteed for us that everything runs smoothly as you travel from your home to these shops on the Internet road. The something is called TCP/IP the core of the journey from your home to your website.

TCP Transmission Control Protocol: It’s like the careful instructions you give to someone delivering a package. It makes sure that your messages (or data) reach the websites correctly and in the right order, just like you’d want your package to reach the shop intact.

IP (Internet Protocol): Think of it as the address system for these shops. Every shop (or website) has its own unique address, and IP makes sure your messages know where to go, just like how you need the address to find a shop.
Data Packets: Instead of sending all the information at once, your messages are divided into smaller parts called packets, which are like small cars on the road. Each packet knows where it’s from, where it’s going, and what part of the message it carries.
Routing: Imagine there are traffic signs and traffic cops (routers) at different points on the road, helping direct these packets (or cars) to the right shops efficiently. They make sure your message takes the best route, just like how you’d take the best roads to reach a shop quickly.
Handshake: When you want to visit a shop (or website), your device and the website do a friendly handshake, saying “Hello!” and “Can I come in?” This handshake sets up a connection, just like how you’d knock on a shop’s door before going in.
Data Transfer: Once the connection is set up, it’s like going into the shop and browsing around. Your device asks for specific things, and the website sends them back to you, just like how you’d pick items from the shop, and the shopkeeper gives them to you.
Closing Connection: When you’re done with the website, it’s like saying “Thank you, goodbye!” and leaving the shop. Your device and the website agree to end the connection, freeing up space for others to use.
So, TCP/IP is like the magic behind your internet journey, ensuring your messages reach the right places (websites) safely and quickly, just like finding your way to different shops on a road without getting lost. Now, dear reader, place yourself in the website owner position. What if you want to restrict some people from entering like one carries a weapon or drunk person or something like this? Here comes the role of Firewall.

.. TA TA TA TAAAAAAA
This is the guard on the shop gate their job is to check every person (data packet) that wants to pass through. They make sure only the safe and authorized ones get through to the shops (websites) while blocking any suspicious or harmful ones. Fun is it not?

I think that you have heard about HTTP. Simply HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack, it is the road between you and the website. Another term is HTTPS Imagine HTTPS/SSL as a special security lock for the doors of the shops (websites) along the internet road. It ensures that when you visit a shop, your interactions are safe and private, just like when you shop at a trusted store with secure locks on its doors. Imagine a load balancer as a smart ticket master outside the cinema. When there’s a big crowd lining up to buy tickets (internet users trying to access a website), the load balancer’s job is to ensure that everyone gets served quickly and efficiently, just like making sure people get their tickets without waiting too long. Managing Crowds: When there’s a long line of people waiting to buy tickets, the load balancer sees this and decides to open up more ticket windows (servers) to handle the load. It’s like opening extra ticket booths at the cinema to serve more customers at once.

Optimizing Performance: By spreading out the crowd and distributing the workload across multiple ticket windows (servers), the load balancer keeps things running smoothly. It prevents any one window from getting too busy, which could slow down the ticket-buying process for everyone, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for all customers.

So, just like a savvy ticket master ensures that everyone gets their tickets without waiting too long by opening up more ticket windows and directing people to the shortest queues, a load balancer ensures that internet traffic is distributed evenly across multiple servers, optimizing performance and ensuring a seamless experience for users accessing websites. I think you now have a complete idea about the process of what happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter and you may get some headache from reading :) but we are almost done.

We have to mention cinema team the ( application server) is like the behind-the-scenes team at the cinema responsible for managing everything beyond ticket sales. It’s where the magic happens to ensure the entire movie-watching experience runs smoothly. Every term in this blog has books to explain but I tried to give you a simple and sweet overview of all of these terms.
